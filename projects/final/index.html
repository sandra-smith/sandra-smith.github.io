        <p>The Counseling Center claims that their mission is to "foster the education, critical thinking, and intellectual growth of its students, the creation and application of new knowledge, the economoic development of the State, and effective engagement of its students, faculty and staff with the surrounding world." Have they accomplished this?</p>
        <p>Many college students struggle with mental health issues -- due to academic demands, financial stresses or social transitions -- and some of these students minimize the efforts the Counseling Center has made to improve the well-being of students at UMD.</p>

        <h2>"The two suicides on campus this year were downplayed. It left these students underrepresented and deprived so many students of any real help," Matthew Dallam, a sophomore mechanical engineering major said. "All we got was an extra day of break."</h2>

       <p>A Healthy Minds survey from the 2021-22 school year shows that of 96,000 students from 133 U.S. colleges, 44% reported symptoms of depression, 36% reported anxiety, and 15% considered suicide.</p>
       <p class="borderedtext"><b>These rates have reached an all-time high over the last 15 years.</b></p>
    <p>For the 2022-2023 school year at UMD, all-intake assessments an individual had throughout the year decreased by 12%. Although more students may need help, less are seeking it from the UMD Counseling Center. </p>

        <p>Despite this, the Counseling Center has seen great improvements through their many programs. For those who are willing to attend, they are recieving help in their daily lives.</p>
        <div class="center">
        <h2 class="center">"The waitlist for appointments is jarring," sophomore biochemistry major Mahi Gandhi said. "Some students I know, including myself, aren't having their concerns taken seriously and are referred to really expensive counseling off campus - it's unfair to do to students."</h2>
    </div>
        <p>Despite these long waitlists and expensive therapy, the Counseling Center offers events such as The Wellness Series or the Self-Care Fair that are free and accessible for students. The Wellness Series are virtual skills sessions that are held every week. The Self-Care Fair is an event held during mental health awareness week that provides students with resources to handle their mental health.</p>
        <p>Anxiety levels have been on the increase since the summer of 2018. Based on a chart provided by the center in their annual report, a poll was taken where students were asked to rate their anxiety levels on a scale form 0-10. These levels have increased from a 3.9 to 5.3 since 2018, with a spike in the winter of 2022 at 5.8. There is a trend in worse mental health conditions during the winter rather than the summers.</p>

        <p>For the Counseling Center to see more improvements and increase the number of students attending their programs, they should reduce costs, focus on event promotion, and make everything more accomodating for 
        students. Their efforts have succeeded in certain ways, but could continue to grow and help students at UMD. </p>
        <p>You are not alone. If you or someone you know is struggling, do not hesitate to reach out for support.</p>
