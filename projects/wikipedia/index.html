    <h1>German Shepard</h1>
    <p>The <b>German Shepard</b> also known in Britain as an <b>Alsatian</b>, is a German breed of working dog of medium
        to large size. The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from
        1899.</p>
    <p>It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work,
        including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work, and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion
        dog, and according to the Fédération Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual
        registrations in 2013.[4]</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>During the 1890s, attempts were being made to standardise dog breeds.[5] Dogs were being bred to preserve traits
        that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators.[6] In Germany this was
        practised within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognised that the breed had
        the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell.[6] The
        results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and
        ability, from one locality to another.[5]</p>

    <p>When the German Shepherd was introduced to the United States it was initially a popular dog.[16] But as the dogs'
        popularity grew, it became associated as a dangerous breed owned by gangsters and bootleggers.[17][18] The
        reputation of the German Shepherds as a dangerous breed had grown to such an extent that it was briefly banned
        to import them in Australia in 1929.[19] Potential legislation was even considered to require that all German
        shepherds in South Australia be sterilised.[20]</p>

<h2>Use as a working dog</h2>
<p>German Shepherds are a popular selection for use as working dogs.[57] They are known for being easy to train and good for performing tasks and following instructions. They are especially well known for their police work, being used for tracking criminals, patrolling troubled areas and detection and holding of suspects. Additionally, thousands of German Shepherds have been used by the military. These military working dogs (MWD) are usually trained for scout duty, and they are used to warn soldiers to the presence of enemies or of booby traps or other hazards.[58] German Shepherds have also been trained by military groups to parachute from aircraft[59] or as anti-tank weapons. They were used in World War II as messenger dogs, rescue dogs and personal guard dogs.[6] A number of these dogs were taken home by foreign servicemen, who were impressed by their intelligence.[6]</p>
<h3>Scent-work Roles</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Search and rescue</li>
    <li>Cadaver searching</li>
    <li>Narcotics detection</li>
    <li>Explosives detection</li>
    <li>Accelerant detection</li>
    <li>Mine detection</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently, Labradors and Golden Retrievers are more widely used for this work, although there are still German Shepherds being trained. In 2013, about 15% of the dogs trained by Guide Dogs of America were German Shepherds, while the remainder are Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers.[62] The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association in the United Kingdom trains some German Shepherds,[63] while the comparable organisation in the US only trains Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers and crosses between these breeds.[64]</p>
